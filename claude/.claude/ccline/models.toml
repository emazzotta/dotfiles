# CCometixLine Model Configuration
# This file defines model display names and context limits for different LLM models
# File location: ~/.claude/ccline/models.toml
#
# Claude models are automatically recognized (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku) with
# version extraction. You only need to add entries here for overrides or
# third-party models.

models = []
context_modifiers = []

# Model configurations (simple substring matching)
# Each [[models]] section defines a model pattern and its properties
# These take priority over built-in Claude model recognition

# Example:
# [[models]]
# pattern = "my-model"
# display_name = "My Model"
# context_limit = 128000

# Context modifiers override context limits and append suffix to display names
# They are matched independently, enabling composition:
#   model "Opus 4" + modifier " 1M" = "Opus 4 1M"

# Example:
# [[context_modifiers]]
# pattern = "[1m]"
# display_suffix = " 1M"
# context_limit = 1000000
